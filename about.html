            <div class="teks-perkenalan">
                <p>I was born in Juhar, Medan. I was raised by my grandparents until I was 8 years old. When I went up to 4th grade, I moved to Bekasi, West Java, and I lived with my parents and younger siblings.</p>
                <p>There, I learned many new things, one of which was being able to ride a motorcycle to school on my own. However, I didn't stay in Bekasi for long. In 9th grade, I was unsure about where to continue my education, and I found information on Instagram about the school I currently attend, SMK Baginu Negeriku.</p>
                <p>This school is located in Semarang and is a boarding school. Inevitably, I moved back to Semarang, leaving my parents and two younger siblings to continue my education. I attended school here and majored in RPL, or Software Engineering. At school, I learned web design and website creation. One of the websites I created is this one.</p>
